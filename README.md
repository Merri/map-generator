**NOTE!** This project is being refactored for better code reuse.

# Map Generator

JavaScript utilities for working with 2D game maps and terrains for the purpose of generating cool looking fields to
play with.

See the [TODO list](https://github.com/Merri/map-generator/wiki) @ wiki.

### Notes

This project started as The Settlers II.net Map Generator, but is going to be abstracted better over time so that the
map generator part becomes independent module that is usable for other games and projects as well.

The current state of this project is running at http://settlers2.net/map-generator/

You can read more about [The Settlers II](http://settlers2.net/) or [Return to the Roots](http://www.rttr.info/) on
their respective sites.

S2.net Map Generator will become it's own project once abstraction is good enough.
