The Settlers II.net Map Generator
=================================

Generates random maps for [The Settlers II](http://settlers2.net/) and [Return to the Roots](http://www.rttr.info/).

This project is running at http://settlers2.net/map-generator/

See the [TODO list](https://github.com/Merri/map-generator/wiki) @ wiki.


Setting up development environment
----------------------------------

Just clone to your preferred git project location. In addition you need Node, Browserify, Reactify and Watchify.

	npm install -g browserify
	npm install -g reactify
	npm install -g watchify

After this you should be able to run continuous preprocessing by typing `npm start`. JavaScript is processed on the fly.

*TODO*: figure out build and dev switch
